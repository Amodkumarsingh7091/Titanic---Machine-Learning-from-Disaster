# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
# Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
# Result
1. Survival Rate:
According to given data there were total 891 passengers in which 342 passengers were survived. Only 38.38% passengers were survived.

2. Impact of Passenger Class:
There were 3 passenger class - class1,class2 and class3. In class1 total 216 passenger in which 136 were survived. In class2 total 134 passenger in which 87 were survived. In class3 total 491 passenger in which only 119 survived. According to this result I can say that survival ratio of class1 is more than class2 and class3. And survival ratio is very less of class3.

3. Effect of Gender:
In 891 passenger there were 314 Female and 577 Male passengers. In 577 male only 109 passenger were survived and in 314 female 233 passenger were survived. It means 74.2% female survived and only 18.89% male survived. So we can say that survival of female passenger is more than male and survival of male passenger is very few.
